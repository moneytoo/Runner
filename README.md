# Runner

_Runner_ is a simple app allowing you to update [**Deep sleeping apps**](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00088422/) on **Samsung** devices running Android (One UI).

### Deep sleeping apps

If you have this feature enabled, unused (as well as manually added) apps will be added to this list. The problem is that these sleeping apps are not visible to _Play Store_, which cannot update them, unless they are temporarily enabled by launching.

This is pretty much how _Runner_ works - it just launches all user installed (non-system) deep sleeping apps, alowing you to check for app updates in the _Play Store_. Once you turn off the screen, all these apps will put to sleep.

## How to update deep sleeping apps

1. Install the latest [apk release](https://github.com/moneytoo/Runner/releases/latest) of _Runner_
2. Start _Runner_ and wait for _Play Store_ to open
3. Select _Check for updates_ and/or wait a few seconds for _Play Store_ to detect app updates
4. Once updated, turn off the display and all these apps will be put to sleep again

\* I have almost 60 deep sleeping apps on my _Galaxy S21 FE_ and all these apps launch in 2 or 3 seconds.
